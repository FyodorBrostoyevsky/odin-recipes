    <h2>A quick and easy lasagna recipe for the masses</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a dish that sits very close to my heart. One that literally saved my life on muliple occasions. 
      As a family out on the streets, many a night were spent huddled around a hot piece of leftover lasagna for warmth. 
      Only after the warmth had faded did we  begint to eat it. 
      This recipe is inspired by cold lasgna and is designed to maximize heat output before being eaten cold.
