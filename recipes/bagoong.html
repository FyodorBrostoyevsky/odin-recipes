    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bagoong Rice is a type of fried rice dish that makes use of shrimp paste or bagoong. 
      This original version of this dish is of Thai origin. 
      However, and since we love bagoong, I made a real quick and easy version of the recipe that everyone can enjoy.

    <p>
      Making your own bagong rice can be hassle free as long as you have all the ingredients. 
      You can use commercially bottled shrimp paste that are already cooked, or you can cook your shrimp paste by following our bagoong guisado recipe. 
      As for the rice, left over steamed rice will work best.
