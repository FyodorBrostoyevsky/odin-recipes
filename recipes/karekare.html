    <h2>Kare Kare Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      This perennial Filipino favorite usually starts with a base of oxtails, beef stew cuts, pork hocks or tripe. 
      Traditionally, the choice meat is simmered for hours to desired tenderness and and along with a variety of vegetables such as banana heart, 
      long beans and eggplant, it’s pulled together into a stew with ground peanuts for flavor, toasted ground rice for thickening  and annatto for coloring. 
      Because of the dish’s very involved cooking process, it is usually reserved for special occasions but by using convenient rice flour and peanut butter, 
      it is simplified enough to be everyday dinner-friendly. Give this a try, my friends, or browse our recipe index for more delicious meal ideas.

          Rinse oxtail under cold, running water and with a knife, trim excess fat. In a deep pot, place oxtails and enough water to cover. 
          Over medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming any scum that accumulates to top. Lower heat, cover and simmer, adding more water as needed to maintain 6 cups, 
          for about 2 to 3 hours or until oxtails are easily pierced with a fork. Drain oxtail, reserving about 6 cups broth.

          Peel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of banana heart until you reach the lighter, softer core. Trim off stem and discard. Cut banana core into half and into fourths. 
          In a bowl of cold salted water, place cut banana and soak for about 15 to 20 minutes. Using hands, squeeze to release bitter sap. Rinse with cold water and drain well, discarding liquid.
